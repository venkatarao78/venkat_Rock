·For The DIY Crafter And Artist
The beach stone crafts and art projects are for teenagers and adults, ranging from a beginner’s level to intermediate. They are mainly of the kind that serve a functional or decorative purpose. However, there are also ideas for other artful creations with beach rocks and pebbles, like making land art (or beach art).

Although this website has a special section devoted to Kids Activities, you can easily adapt ideas from this section to create your own projects with rocks and pebbles (e.g. Ladybug Crafts and Angel Crafts) for children’s birthday parties, family gatherings, to make holiday art for your classroom or for school bazars.

So Where Do You Begin?

Begin wherever you like. But if you haven't done so yet, go to Beach Rocks Info and get some basic knowledge on beach rocks and pebbles first. It will help you learn to identify beach pebbles and decide what kind of beach stones you would like to incorporate into your craft and art projects.

 

To those of you who are new to creating beach stone crafts and art, here’s a list of what you need:

1.    Some inspiring and suitable beach pebbles and beach rocks                                                                                                                 

If you truly love beach pebbles you may argue that they are all amazing and inspiring in their own way, and you are right. However, not all pebbles are suitable for the same kind of beach stone crafts and artwork – size, color, shape, texture, hardness, must all be taken into consideration for a successful craft or art project. You can buy some special beach pebbles online for your crafts, as well as some exceptional ones for your jewelry art, or you can purchase cheap and more common sea pebbles and river pebbles at your local garden supplies store.

2.    Tools and supplementary materials                                     

The number and kind of tools and supplementary materials you will need depends on what you want to make. The style you prefer, the technique you are going to use, the receiver (if you intend to offer it as a gift), all play a role. For example, you can chose to make a pebble pendant with macramé strings, or a hand-painted one, or a wire-wrapped piece, or you can create a design which combines all these three materials. It also depends on the message you would like to convey through your beach stones crafts and artwork. E.g. you can decorate your beach pebble wall art with upcycled materials including plastic and fiberglass, or with natural materials without any plastic or fiberglass.       

3.    Space to work in and a surface to work on                                                                                                      This could be space and a surface outdoors or indoors, depending on: how messy your project is going to be, how much space you need, whether you’re going to use spray or liquid substances you mustn’t inhale (I strongly recommend you avoid such products if there is an alternative solution), the kind of art you create (e.g. beach rock balancing is much more effective as artwork made and photographed on the beach than in any other location), etc.

4.    Ideas for your artwork and crafts                                                                                                   Where to look for ideas? First of all, click on all links of this website and you will get plenty of ideas. Other sources are: printed books and e-books, downloadable pdf tutorials, e-courses for making beach stone crafts and art, online or offline workshops, websites and blogs where you can see other people’s rock art and pebble art, related boards and pins on Pinterest. Never copy other people’s work - use it only for inspiration, to ignite the flame of the creative thinking process.

5.    The right mindset

a. Start with intention (know what you want to make and why).

b. Focus on whatever it is you are creating. Put your heart in it.

c. Experiment and learn from your mistakes.          

d. Listen carefully when people talk about your handcrafted creations.

e. Find alternative solutions, if it is not working. Don’t give up.

f.  Be proud of your efforts, progress and achievements (even the smallest).

g. Share what you learn in the process, as well as your results, with the world (on your blog or a social media platform).
